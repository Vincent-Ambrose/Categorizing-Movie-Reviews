Description of the project:

We will use a dataset of IMDb (Internet Movie Database) with polarity legends to build a model to classify positive and negative reviews. 
The goal is to train a model to detect negative reviews automatically.

The project is done in VS code with Jupyter Notebook extension.

In this repository you can find the .tsv file to perform this analysis
